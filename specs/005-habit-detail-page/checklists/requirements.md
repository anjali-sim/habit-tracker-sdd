# Specification Quality Checklist: HabitFlow Habit Detail Page

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-05-22
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass. Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.
- The "no chart libraries — pure CSS grid" implementation constraint is captured as FR-012 (framed as "native browser layout capabilities only") and in Assumptions, keeping the spec technology-agnostic while faithfully preserving the design intent.
- Heatmap tooltip/hover interaction explicitly excluded in Assumptions to prevent scope creep.
- First-day-of-week (Sun vs Mon) deferred to design-time decision as noted in Assumptions.
